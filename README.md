# What do you need to be hired at Google?

This is an Exploratory Data Analysis of Google Careers that includes the analysis of the requirements to land a job at Google such as soft skills, software skills, degree requirements, etc. This repository contains the Google csv data stored in the [data](https://github.com/adrianromano/Analysis-of-Google-Careers/tree/master/data) folder and the [Python Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/adrianromano/Analysis-of-Google-Careers/blob/master/Google%20Careers%20-%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb) that contains the Python codes and the analysis.

The data was made publicly in Kaggle and is available to access from my repository or by clicking the source [here](https://www.kaggle.com/niyamatalmass/google-job-skills).
